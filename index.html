          Today, I stand before you with a simple belief: poverty is not created
          by the poor, but by the systems we build. At Grameen Bank, we proved
          that even the smallest loan can spark the greatest change. We saw the
          power of trust, particularly in women, who transformed their families
          and communities. Our world needs an economy of kindness, one that
          uplifts every human being. Let us imagine a future without poverty,
          inequality, or unemployment. Together, we can build itâ€”with
          innovation, compassion, and a shared commitment to the dignity of all.
          Remember, small actions create big revolutions.

          "Bangladesh 2.0" refers to the nation's transformative phase following
          the August 2024 political upheaval, which led to the ousting of Prime
          Minister Sheikh Hasina and the installation of Nobel laureate Muhammad
          Yunus as interim leader. This period is characterized by significant
          reforms aimed at establishing a more democratic and inclusive society.

              Bangladesh's journey into space began with the successful launch
              of Bangabandhu-1, its first geostationary communications
              satellite, on May 12, 2018. Launched from Kennedy Space Center in
              Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, this milestone marked
              Bangladesh as the 57th nation to operate a satellite.

              In 2024, Bangladesh experienced severe flooding that caused
              significant loss of life and widespread displacement. In August,
              heavy rainfall and water surges from upstream regions affected 11
              districts, resulting in at least 71 fatalities and impacting
              approximately 5.8 million people.
